# Political-Speech-generator-Natural-language-Processing-
A project in Natural Language Generation. We are using the Convote dataset of Congressional Floor Speeches to model the internal characteristics of two US Political parties. Our ambition is to build a political speech generator that yields a resonable 'speech' (of a few sentences) that is grammatically and contextually accurate.
